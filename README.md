## CrossFit & Kettlebell Interactive HTML Prototype Requirements Document

### 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a self-contained, interactive HTML prototype for a CrossFit & Kettlebell Training Hub. The prototype should be designed for clarity, interactivity, responsiveness, and ease of use without external dependencies.

  * Tabs should be interactive, smoothly transitioning content without page refresh.

#### 2.2 Exercise Section

* **Exercise Cards Grid:**

  * Cards displaying exercise details: title, description, difficulty, muscle groups.
  * Difficulty labels color-coded (Green: Beginner, Orange: Intermediate, Red: Advanced).
  * Muscle group tags clearly visible and formatted as pills.
  * Cards expand on click to show full details (variations, technique tips, common mistakes).

#### 2.3 WODs Section

* **WOD Cards:**

  * Display title, short description, and exercise list.
  * Interactive expansion for additional details if provided.

#### 2.4 Body Type Programs Section

### 3. UI/UX Requirements

* **Responsiveness:**

  * Fully responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  * Use CSS media queries for smooth, responsive adjustments.

* **Interactive Feedback:**

  * Button hover states (highlighting, subtle scale-up).
  * Smooth content transitions (fade-in/out, slide down/up).

* **Visual Design:**

  * Dark-themed UI with orange accent colors (gradient: #ff6b35 to #f7931e).
  * Clear typography, using readable sans-serif fonts like Segoe UI or similar.

### 4. Technical Requirements

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:**

  * Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
  * No external libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery) to ensure standalone functionality.

* **JavaScript Functionality:**

  * Event listeners for interaction handling (tab switching, card expansion).
  * Dynamic DOM manipulation to toggle content visibility smoothly.

* **Animation:**

  * Utilize CSS keyframes and transitions for smooth UI interactions.

---

### 5. Performance Requirements

* **Load Time Optimization:**

  * Minimize inline CSS and JS to ensure quick loading.
  * Efficient DOM manipulation and minimal repaint/reflow for smooth interactions.

* **Memory Management:**

  * Efficient use of event listeners and DOM element creation/deletion.

### 6. Accessibility Requirements

* **Keyboard Navigation:**

  * Ensure tab navigation compatibility.

* **Semantic HTML:**

  * Proper heading structures (h1-h6), meaningful div/class naming.

---

### 7. Testing & Validation

  * Ensure consistent rendering in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

* **Device Testing:**

  * Validate responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

---

### 8. Deliverables

* Single interactive HTML file.
* Clearly commented source code.
* Documentation comments explaining core JavaScript functions.

---
